# Ecommerce Website

## Description
This project is the course project for Agile Development course taught by Professor Raman Ramsin at Sharif University of Technology.
The final results must include a fully functioning e-commerce website with registerting, buying and selling capabilities for users and monitoring features for admin.

## Registeration
Users are able to sign up in the website as both normal users (buyers) or companies (providing company ID and name). They can login to their profiles using their chosen username and password.

## Companies
### Contract
Each company should make a contract with the owners in order to be allowed to sell its products on the website. The contract must include information about the number of products and the profit of the owner in percents.
The admin will recieve the contract proposal and can accept or reject the contract.
### Balance
Companies must charge their balance in order to have their products displayed on the website. The owner's profit is taken from the companie's balance. When the balance is under a certain amount, the company will recieve a notification and if they don't charge their balance, the companies' products will no longer be displayed.
### Products
Companies can add new products for sale by entering required information such as name, description, size, color and photos of the product.
### Campaigns
Companies can start advertisement campaigns by paying a certain amount and choosing a time window in which the advertisement will show on the website.

## Users
### Shopping
Users have access to the list of all products and can have them viewed based on three different categories. They can choose the right size and color and add the item to their shopping cart.
Users have access to the shopping cart in their profile and can finalize their purchase from there. 
### Checkout
Upon finalizing their purchase the users can enter their post address and information and be directed to the transaction page. They can enter their credit card info there and pay the indicated price.

## Admin
### Monitoring
The website's admin has access to the list of users (both company and non-company) and all the items sold on the website in the form of lists containing company and buyer's names and the date of purchase and the amount of profit earned by the website.
